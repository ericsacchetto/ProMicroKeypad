# ProMicroKeypad

The Pro Micro Keypad uses 9 switches to drive Windows shortcuts.
It is based on the Arduino Pro Micro (ATMega 32u4).

Nine Cherry MX Keys were used, turning on the corresponding LED for brief period of time once the ky is pressed.

A rotary encoder was included in order to easily control the volume.

The HID library https://github.com/NicoHood/HID was used, which provided an easy implementation of the shortcut key code.

All the schematic and PCB design were done using KiCad.
